# Image Compression using K-Means

This project is an implementation of image compression using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The main goal is to reduce the file size of an image while preserving its visual quality. The K-Means algorithm is used to group similar colors in the image, and then a compressed version of the image is generated with fewer colors.

## Features
- Image compression using K-Means clustering.
- Visualization of the compressed and original images.
- Adjustable compression level to control the number of colors in the compressed image.

- Foundation of ML (cs725)
- Coursera ML specilization
